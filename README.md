This repository is dedicated for the Headphone amplifier project. In this repository you are going to find the schematic of the project, a pcb report document and a folder with the manufacturing files of the pcb. Weâ€™re also going to talk about the initial requirements I had with the design, the reasons I choose to use the final circuit topology, the components I used in this Project.
